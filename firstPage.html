	<p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple <strong>language</strong> made up of <em>elements</em>, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (is it a paragraph? is it a bulleted list? is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (does it have a header? three columns of content? a navigation menu?) and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these, and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>

	<p>An excellent Mozilla foundation course that explores and tests a lot of the skills talked about in the Introduction to HTML module. Learners get familiar with reading, writing and participating on the web in this six-part module. Discover the foundations of the web through production and collaboration.</p>
